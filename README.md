## Analysis and Visualization of Phylogenetic Tree with Large-Language Models.

### <ins> Automated Tree Annotationa and Interpretation</ins>:
Annotating trees with relevant biological information and provide natural language interpretation of the information. 
- using BLAST or other methods, automate the process of adding relevant biological information.
- Privide a brief summary of the given phylogenetic tree using the annotated information.
  
### <ins>Natural Language Querying of Phylogenetic Data</ins>:
An LLM-powered interface that allows researchers to query complex population genetic datasets using natural language. For example, a researcher could ask:
1. "Show me high region of high genetic diversity in population A compared to population B"
2. "Identify potential selective sweeps in the last 1000 generations."
     
  The LLM would interprete these queries, translate them into appropriate statistical analyses and present the results in an easily understandable format.

### <ins>Interactive Visualization with Natural Language Explanations</ins>: 
A visualization tool for phylogenetic trees and population genetic data that uses LLM to provide context-aware explanations. As user explores the visualization, the can ask the questions:
  1. Why does this branch have long length.
  2. What does the pattern in this tree suggest about the speciation rates.

The LLM would provide real-time, context-aware explanation, enhancing the user's understanding of the data.
